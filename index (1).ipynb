    "Here ends the \"Protein_chain_A\" moleculetype definition. Then the \"Protein_chain_L\" moleculetype definition starts. The remainder of the topology file is dedicated to defining other molecules and providing system-level descriptions. The next moleculetype (by default) is the solvent, in this case TIP3P water. Other typical choices for water include SPC, SPC/E, and TIP4P. We chose this by passing \"-water tip3p\" to `gmx pdb2gmx`. For an excellent summary of the many different water models, click [here](http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_models.html) , but be aware that not all of these models are present within GROMACS."

    "EM ensured that we have a reasonable starting structure, in terms of geometry and solvent orientation. To begin real dynamics, we must equilibrate the solvent and ions around the protein. If we were to attempt unrestrained dynamics at this point, the system may collapse. The reason is that the solvent is mostly optimized within itself, and not necessarily with the solute, and ions are randomly placed by replacing water molecules."

    "Remember that posre.itp file that pdb2gmx generated a long time ago? We're going to use it now. The purpose of posre.itp is to apply a position restraining force on the heavy atoms of the protein (anything that is not a hydrogen). Movement is permitted, but only after overcoming a substantial energy penalty. The utility of position restraints is that they allow us to relax our solvent and ions around our protein, without the added variable of structural changes in the protein. The origin of the position restraints (the coordinates at which the restraint potential is zero) is provided via a coordinate file passed to the -r option of grompp. Depending from the protein and ion types, this process may also be in the order nanoseconds."

The reference pressure was set to 1 bar, so is this outcome acceptable? Pressure is a quantity that fluctuates widely over the course of an MD simulation, as is clear from the large root-mean-square fluctuation (in the order of 100 bar), so statistically speaking, one cannot distinguish a difference between the obtained average and the target/reference value (1 bar). \n",
